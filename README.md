# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Prediction

#Description
Credit card customer churn prediction leverages advanced techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to foresee and mitigate customer attrition. ANNs, inspired by the human brain, play a pivotal role in this process. They analyze historical customer data, considering factors like transaction history, payment behavior, and demographics. Through training and optimization, ANNs learn to identify which customer will leave the bank.
